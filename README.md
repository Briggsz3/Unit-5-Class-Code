# Functions

## Lesson 1 - Functions
* Students will be able to 
  * modularize (separate into sections) their programs with functions
## Lesson 2 - Function and Parameters
* Students will be able to 
  * effectively use parameters to customize functions in their programs
## Lesson 3 - Namespaces in Functions
* Students will be able to
  * describe the different namespaces with regards to variables and functions
## Lesson 4 - Functions and Return Values
* Students will be able to
  * remove complexity from their programs by abstracting with functions 
  * generalize their functions with parameters 
  * chain functions together using return values
## Lesson 5 - Exceptions
* Students will be able to
  * create programs that can gracefully handle exceptions
  * continue to function when an error is raised
